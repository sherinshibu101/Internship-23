#HOW DID I APPROACH THE NODE CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM?

THIS IS THE FIRST DATASET IVE APPLIED GAT :
CALLED THE CITESEER DATASET (uploaded the dataset incase needed)
Preprocessed the data in citeseer for node classification
Ensured that the adjacency matrix, feature matrix and labels created where consistent
Prepared the data for training on GAT 
Trained the data and obtained the accuracy level
Adjusted the optimizers and no of epochs and observed their influence
Got an accuracy of  app. 97%


THIS IS THE SECOND DATASET IVE APPLIED GAT:
CALLED THE CORA DATASET (uploaded that too)
Preprocessed the data for node classification
Ensured that the adjacency matrix, feature matrix and labels were aligned
Prepared the data for GAT training 
Trained and obtained the accuracy level
Focused more on increasing the no of hidden layers tho did change the no of epochs and adjusted for different values in the dropout rate
An increase in the no of layers improved the accuracy significantly
Got an accuracy of 99.45%
