# Approach to Node Classification Using Graph Attention Networks (GAT)

### Dataset 1: CiteSeer
- **Objective:** Applied GAT on the CiteSeer dataset for node classification.
- **Steps:**
  - Preprocessed the dataset for consistency in the adjacency matrix, feature matrix, and labels.
  - Prepared the data for GAT training.
  - Trained the model and obtained accuracy.
  - Experimented with optimizers and the number of epochs to observe their effects.
  - **Result:** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 97%.

### Dataset 2: Cora
- **Objective:** Applied GAT on the Cora dataset for node classification.
- **Steps:**
  - Preprocessed the dataset ensuring alignment of the adjacency matrix, feature matrix, and labels.
  - Prepared the data for GAT training.
  - Trained the model and monitored accuracy.
  - Focused on increasing the number of hidden layers, while also experimenting with different epoch counts and dropout rates.
  - **Result:** Achieved an accuracy of 99.45%.
